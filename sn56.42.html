<h1>SN 56.42. The  Precipice</h1>

<p>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture’s Peak. There he addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, let’s go to the Peak of Inspiration to spend the day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the mendicants replied.</p>

<p>Then the Buddha and a number of mendicants went to the Peak of Inspiration. A certain mendicant saw the deep precipice off the Peak of Inspiration and said to the Buddha:</p>

<p>“Venerable sir, that precipice is really deep and truly scary! Is there any precipice that is deeper and more scary?”</p>

<p>“There is such a precipice indeed, mendicant.”</p>

<p>“Which precipice is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Some renunciants and brahmins do not understand suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice leading to the cessation of suffering as they really are. They enjoy willful actions that lead to birth, to old age, to death, to sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. Enjoying those willful actions, they will perform them. Having performed those willful actions, they will fall down the precipice of birth, the precipice of old age, the precipice of death, the precipice of sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. They won’t get liberated from birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. They won’t get liberated from suffering, I tell you.</p>

<p>Mendicants, that is why you should take action to understand suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice leading to the cessation of suffering.”</p>
