<h1>Translation philosophy</h1>
- aims: contemplation, accessible

These translations, meant as tools for personal contemplation, aim to speak to the reader as directly as possible. Therefore the instructions are wherever possible  set in the second person rather than the third, and sometimes the plural is used to assure gender-neutrality. Unnatural direct quotations and other Pāli-specific ways of speech are often rephrased. Abridgements in the originals are always expanded, but for sake of flow strings of pure synonyms and pragmatically redundant repetitions (artifacts of the oral transmission) may be abbreviated instead.
- Buddhas words in first person.
- Nouns into verbs.
- Removed Pali diacritics in names.
- Present alternative translations 

Not a replacement but an addition.
