<h2>SN 22.100: The Second Discourse on the Leash (partial)</h2>
<p>At Sāvatthī.</p>

<p>“Mendicants, transmigration has no discernible beginning. You will find no start to the transmigration of beings who roam around blinded by ignorance and chained by craving. Imagine a dog on a leash tied to a strong post or pillar. Whenever he walks, stands, sits, or lies down, he does so right beside that post or pillar. Likewise, unlearned ordinary people perceive form to be ‘me, mine, my self’. They perceive feeling, perception, will, and consciousness to be ‘me, mine, my self’. Whenever they walk, stand, sit, or lie down, they do so right along those five taken up aspects of existence. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified. </p>

<p>Mendicants, have you seen the picture called ‘Wandering’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Reverend.”</p>

<p>“The diversity in that picture called ‘Wandering’ is made by the mind. Yet the mind is even more diverse than that picture. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>I do not know any order of beings so diverse as the animal realm. The diversity in the animal realm is also made by the mind. Yet the mind is even more diverse than that. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>It’s like an artist or a painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board or a wall or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson. When unlearned ordinary people produce a next life, they produce just form, feeling, perception, will, and consciousness.”</p>
