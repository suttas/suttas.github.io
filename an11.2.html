<h1>AN 11.2. You do not have to intent</h1>

<p>“Mendicants, if you are virtuous, if you are of good behavior, you do not have to intent to become remorseless. It is natural to become remorseless if you are virtuous, if you are of good behavior. If you are remorseless, you do not have to intent to become glad. It is natural to become glad if you are remorseless. If you are glad, you do not have to intent to become delighted. It is natural to become delighted if you are glad. If you have a delighted mind, you do not have to intent for your body to become tranquil. It is natural for your body to become tranquil if you are delighted. If your body is tranquil, you do not have to intent to experience pleasure. It is natural to experience pleasure if your body is tranquil. If you experience pleasure, you do not have to intent for your mind to unify. It is natural for your mind to unify if you experience pleasure. If your mind gets unified, you do not have to intent to get to know and see things as they really are. It is natural to get to know and see things as they really are if your mind gets unified. If you know and see things as they really are, you do not have to intent to become disillusioned. It is natural to become disillusioned if you know and see things as they really are. If you are disillusioned, you do not have to intent to lose desire. It is natural to lose desire if you are disillusioned. If you lose desire, you do not have to intent to know and see liberation. It is natural you'll know and see liberation if you lose desire.</p>

<p>So, mendicants, knowing and seeing liberation is the purpose and beneficial outcome of loss of desire. Loss of desire is the purpose and beneficial outcome of disillusionment. Disillusionment is the purpose and beneficial outcome of knowing and seeing things as they really are. Knowing and seeing things as they really are is the purpose and beneficial outcome of unification of the mind. Unification of the mind is the purpose and beneficial outcome of pleasure. Pleasure is the purpose and beneficial outcome of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and beneficial outcome of delight. Delight is the purpose and beneficial outcome of gladness. Gladness is the purpose and beneficial outcome of remorselessness. Remorselessness is the purpose and beneficial outcome of  good behavior.</p>

<p>That is how, for you to go from this shore to the other shore, certain qualities flow on to other qualities, certain qualities fulfill other qualities.” </p>
