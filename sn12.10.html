<h1>SN 12.10. Gotama</h1>

<p>“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was heading for awakening but not yet fully awake—I thought: ‘Oh no! People have really gotten into trouble. They are born, age, die, pass on, and are reborn again. Yet they don’t see any escape from this suffering, this old age and death and so on. When will an escape from all this finally be found?’</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be old age and death, only if there is what? What are old age and death dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be old age and death, only if there is birth. Old age and death depend on birth.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be birth, only if there is what? What is birth dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be birth, only if there is continued existence. Birth depends on continued existence.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be continued existence, only if there is what? What is continued existence dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be continued existence, only if there is fuel/taking up. Continued existence depends on fuel/taking up.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be fuel/taking up, only if there is what? What is fuel/taking up dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be fuel/taking up, only if there is craving. Fuel/taking up depends on craving.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be craving, only if there is what? What is craving dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be craving, only if there are sensations. Craving depends on sensations.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be sensations, only if there is what? What are sensations dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be sensations, only if there are sense impressions. Sensations depend on sense impressions.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be sense impressions, only if there is what? What are sense impressions dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be sense impressions, only if there are the six senses. Sense impressions depend on the six senses.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be the six senses, only if there is what? What are the six senses dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be the six senses, only if there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. The six senses depend on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, only if there is what? What are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, only if there is consciousness. The individual’s immaterial aspects and body depend on consciousness.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be consciousness, only if there is what? What is consciousness dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be consciousness, only if there are willful actions. Consciousness depends on willful actions.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be willful actions, only if there is what? What are willful actions dependent on?’ Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there will be willful actions, only if there is ignorance. Willful actions depend on ignorance.</p>

<p>So, dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, consciousness. Dependent on consciousness, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. Dependent on sense impressions, sensations. Dependent on sensations, craving. Dependent on craving, fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, continued existence. Dependent on continued existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p>Mendicants, that is how I understood origination, gaining insight, comprehension, understanding, knowledge, and illumination of things not taught before.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be old age and death, if there isn’t what? Old age and death will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be old age and death, if there is no birth. If birth ceases, old age and death will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be birth, if there isn’t what? Birth will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be birth, if there is no continued existence. If continued existence ceases, birth will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be continued existence, if there isn’t what? Continued existence will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be continued existence, if there is no fuel/taking up. If fuel/taking up ceases, continued existence will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be fuel/taking up, if there isn’t what? Fuel/taking up will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be fuel/taking up, if there is no craving. If craving ceases, fuel/taking up will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be craving, if there isn’t what? Craving will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be craving, if there are no sensations. If sensations cease, craving will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be sensations, if there isn’t what? Sensations will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be sensations, if there are no sense impressions. If sense impressions cease, sensations will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be sense impressions, if there isn’t what? Sense impressions will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be sense impressions, if there are no six senses. If the six senses cease, sense impressions will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be the six senses, if there isn’t what? The six senses will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be the six senses, if there are no immaterial aspects and body. If the individual’s immaterial aspects and body cease, the six senses will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, if there isn’t what? The individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, if there is no consciousness. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be consciousness, if there isn’t what? Consciousness will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be consciousness, if there are no willful actions. If willful actions cease, consciousness will cease.</p>

<p>Then I thought: ‘There won’t be willful actions, if there isn’t what? Willful actions will cease, if what ceases? Then, by focusing properly, I comprehended it, understanding that there won’t be willful actions, if there is no ignorance. If ignorance ceases, willful actions will cease.</p>

<p>So, if ignorance completely fades away and ceases, willful actions will cease. If willful actions cease, consciousness will cease. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease. If the individual’s immaterial aspects and body cease, the six senses will cease. If the six senses cease, sense impressions will cease. If sense impressions cease, sensations will cease. If sensations cease, craving will cease. If craving ceases, fuel/taking up will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, continued existence will cease. If continued existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.</p>

<p>Mendicants, that is how I understood cessation, gaining insight, comprehension, understanding, knowledge, and illumination of things not taught before.”</p>
