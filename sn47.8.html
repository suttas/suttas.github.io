<h1>SN 47.8. The Cook</h1>
<p>Mendicants, imagine a bad, foolish, and inexperienced cook attending to a king or a king’s adviser. He serves him various kinds of curries: sour, bitter, hot, sweet, sharp, mild, spicy, and bland ones. But he fails to notice the signs of his master. He does not notice which curry pleased his master on a given day, which one he reached for, which one he ate lots of, or which one he praised. That cook would not gain clothes, wages, and gifts. Why? Because that bad, foolish, and inexperienced cook fails to notice the signs of his master.</p>

<p>Likewise, some bad, foolish, and inexperienced mendicant might meditate on a certain aspect of the body, a certain sensation, a certain aspect of the mind, or a certain phenomenon—motivated, aware, and non-‍forgetful, free from longing and aversion for worldly things. As he does so, his mind does not unify, his impurities are not abandoned, and he fails to notice the signs of that. That mendicant does not gain blissful abidings in this very life, and he does not gain non-‍forgetfulness and awareness. Why? Because that bad, foolish, and inexperienced mendicant fails to notice the signs of own his mind.</p>
