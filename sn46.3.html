<h1>SN 46.3. Virtue</h1>
<p>“Mendicants, there are mendicants who are accomplished in virtue, unification of mind, knowledge, and liberation, in knowing and seeing liberation. Even just seeing them is helpful, I tell you. Even just hearing them, approaching them, paying homage to them, recollecting them, or ordaining with them is helpful, I tell you.</p>

<p>Why? Because after hearing the teaching from such mendicants, you’ll dwell secluded in body and mind, and you’ll recollect and reflect upon it. When that happens, the awakening factor of non-&zwj;forgetfulness is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>Being non-&zwj;forgetful like that, you investigate, explore, and examine that teaching with understanding. When that happens, the awakening factor of investigation is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>If you examine, investigate, and explore the teachings with your understanding, tireless energy is aroused in you. When that happens, the awakening factor of energy is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>If energy is aroused in you, non-physical delight arises. When that happens, the awakening factor of delight is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>If your mind is delighted, your body and mind become tranquil. When that happens, the awakening factor of tranquility is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>If your body is tranquil and you feel bliss, your mind unifies. When that happens, the awakening factor of unification of mind is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>You observe that unified mind closely and even-mindedly. When that happens, the awakening factor of even-mindedness is aroused in you. Then you develop it, and by developing it, it gets fulfilled.</p>

<p>When the seven awakening factors are practiced and developed in this way, you can expect seven fruits and benefits. What are those seven fruits and benefits?</p>

<p>You may attain perfect wisdom in this life. If not, then you may attain perfect wisdom at the time of death. If not, then you may end the five chains to lower rebirths and get fully extinguished in the in-between. If not, then you may end the five chains to lower rebirths and get fully extinguished when arriving. If not, then you may end the five chains to lower rebirths and get fully extinguished without using any more will. If not, then you may end the five chains to lower rebirths and get fully extinguished after using more will. If not, then you may end the five chains to lower rebirths and move upwards to the Akanittha realm.</p>

<p>When the seven awakening factors are practiced and developed in this way, you can expect these seven fruits and benefits.”</p>
