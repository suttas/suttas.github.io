<h1>SN 56.14. The Senses</h1>

<p>“Mendicants, there are these four truths of the Noble One. What four? The Noble One’s truth of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the cessation of suffering, and of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering. Those are the four truths of the Noble One.</p>

<p>And what is the Noble One’s truth of suffering? The six senses, you should answer. What six? The sense of sight, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind. That is what’s called the Noble One’s truth of suffering.</p>

<p>And what is the Noble One’s truth of the origin of suffering? It is the craving that leads to a next life, which, along with enjoyment and desire, looks for happiness in all sorts of  realms. That is to say: craving for sensual objects, craving for existence, and craving for eradication. That is what’s called the Noble One’s truth of the origin of suffering.</p>

<p>And what is the Noble One’s truth of the cessation of suffering? It is the complete cessation and fading away of that very same craving—giving it up, relinquishing it, being free and detached from it. That is what’s called the Noble One’s truth of the cessation of suffering.</p>

<p>And what is the Noble One’s truth of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering? It is the noble eightfold path, which consists of right view, right intentions, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right non-&zwj;forgetfulness, and right unification of mind. That is what’s called the Noble One’s truth of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

<p>Mendicants, that is why you should take action to understand what suffering is, what the origin of suffering is, what the cessation of suffering is, and what the practice leading to the cessation of suffering is.”</p>
