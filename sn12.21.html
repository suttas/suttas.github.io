<h1>SN 12.21. Ten Powers</h1>

<p>At Savatthi.</p>

<p> “Mendicants, I, the Truthfinder—with ten powers and four reasons to be self-confident—claim the bull’s place in the herd, roar my lion’s roar in gatherings, and put in motion the Supreme Wheel, saying: ‘This is how form is, this is how it originates, and this is how it disappears. This is how sensation is, this is how it originates, and this is how it disappears. This is how perception is, this is how it originates, and this is how it disappears. This is how will is, this is how it originates, and this is how it disappears. This is how consciousness is, this is how it originates, and this is how it disappears.</p>

<p> Namely: There will be <em>this</em>, only if there is <em>that</em>.<sup><a href="#n17" id="l17">[17]</a></sup> <em>This</em> arises, because <em>that</em> arises. If there weren’t <em>that</em>, there won’t be <em>this</em>. If <em>that</em> ceases, <em>this</em> will cease.</p>

<p>That is to say: Dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, consciousness. Dependent on consciousness, the individual’s inner aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s inner aspects and body, the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. Dependent on sense impressions, sensations. Dependent on sensations, craving. Dependent on craving, fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, continued existence. Dependent on continued existence, birth. And dependent on birth, there come to be old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p>But if ignorance totally fades away and ceases, willful actions will cease. If willful actions cease, consciousness will cease. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s inner aspects and body will cease. If the individual’s inner aspects and body cease, the six senses will cease. If the six senses cease, sense impressions will cease. If sense impressions cease, sensations will cease. If sensations cease, craving will cease. If craving ceases, fuel/taking up will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, continued existence will cease. If continued existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.’”</p>
