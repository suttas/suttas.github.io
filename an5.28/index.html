<h2>AN 5.28: Five-factored</h2>

<p>“Mendicants, I will teach you the noble five-factored right unification of the mind. Please listen and pay close attention to what I shall say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the mendicants replied.</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha then said: “So, mendicants, how do you develop the noble five-factored right unification of the mind?</p>

<p>Then, after you get fully separated from sensual experiences and unskillful states of mind, you attain the first jhana, where there is delight and bliss caused by the separation, to which the mind moves and holds on. You drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with delight and bliss caused by the separation, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. Imagine a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice pouring bath powder into a metal dish and sprinkling it gradually with water. He kneads it until the lump of bath powder is soaked and saturated, filled with moisture throughout, yet none of it trickles out. Likewise, you drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with delight and bliss caused by the separation, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. That is the first step in the development of the noble five-factored right unification of the mind.</p>

<p>Further, after the moving and holding subside, you attain the second jhana, where the mind is confident within and at one, not moving or holding on, so there is just delight and bliss caused by the unification. You drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with delight and bliss caused by the unification, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. Imagine a lake which has no water flowing in from the east, west, north, or south, and which is also never replenished with rain. But it has water welling up within. The spring of water welling up within the lake drenches, suffuses, fills, pervades that lake with cool water, so that no single part of the lake is not pervaded with it. Likewise, you drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with delight and bliss caused by the unification, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. That is the second step in the development of the noble five-factored right unification of the mind.</p>

<p>Further, after the delight fades away too, you attain the third jhana, where even-minded, mindfully, and aware, you yourself experience just bliss, which the noble ones describe as blissful abiding, equanimous and mindfully. You drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with the bliss free from delight, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. Imagine blue water lilies, pink lotuses, or white lotuses in a pond. Some of them thrive underwater, sprouting and growing in the water without rising above the surface. They are drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded with cool water from the tip to the root. Likewise, you drenched, suffused, filled, pervaded your experience with the bliss free from delight, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. That is the third step in the development of the noble five-factored right unification of the mind.</p>

<p>Further, after the bliss is abandoned, you attain the fourth jhana—the purification of mindfulness and equanimity—where, since pain was abandoned, and earlier unhappiness and happiness ended too, there is just a neutral feeling. You sit having pervaded your experience with the pure bright mind, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. Imagine a man sitting, covered head to toe with a white cloth, so that no single part of him is not covered by it. Likewise, you sit having pervaded your experience with the pure bright mind, so that there is no single part of your whole experience that is not pervaded with it. That is the fourth step in the development of development of the noble five-factored right unification of the mind.</p>

<p>Further, the aspect of reviewing is well grasped, focused on, remembered, and penetrated by your understanding of it. It is like one person may look at another—like one standing may look at one sitting or one sitting may look at one lying down. The aspect of reviewing is well grasped, focused on, remembered, and penetrated by your understanding of it. That is the fifth step in the development of the noble five-factored right unification of the mind.</p>

<p>Mendicants, when you practiced and developed the noble five-factored right unification of the mind like this, you will be able to realize anything that can be realized through special power, to whatever possible extent, if you direct your mind to it.</p>

<p>Imagine a water jar placed on a stand, filled to the brim with water. If a strong man tips it any direction, would the water pour out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Likewise, when you practiced and developed the noble five-factored right unification of the mind like this, you will be able to realize anything that can be realized through special power, to whatever possible extent, if you direct your mind to it.”</p>

<p>Imagine a square walled lotus pond on level ground, filled to the brim with water. If a strong man opens the embankment on any side, would the water pour out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Likewise, when you practiced and developed the noble five-factored right unification of the mind like this, you will be able to realize anything that can be realized through special power, to whatever possible extent, if you direct your mind to it.</p>

<p>Imagine a chariot with harnessed thoroughbreds standing at a level crossroads, with a goad placed at the ready. A skilled horse trainer and charioteer could mount the chariot, take the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right, and ride out and return wherever and whenever he likes. Likewise, when you practiced and developed the noble five-factored right unification of the mind like this, you will be able to realize anything that can be realized through special power, to whatever possible extent, if you direct your mind to it.</p>

<p>If you wish to possess the various kinds of psychic powers, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent. You can multiply yourself and become one again; appear and vanish; walk unhindered through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if they were space; diveg in and out of the earth as if it were water; walk on water as if it were earth; fly cross-legged through space like a bird; touchthe powerful and mighty sun and moon with your hands; and exert mastery over your body as far as the world of Brahmā. </p>

<p>If you wish to hear both kind of sounds with the purified and superhuman divine sense of hearing, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent. You can hear both human and divine sounds, whether near or far.</p>

<p>If you wish to know the minds of other beings and persons, being able to read their minds with yours, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent. You can know a desirous mind to be desirous and an undesirous mind to be undesirous, know an angry mind to be angry and an unangry mind to be unangry, know a deluded mind to be deluded and an undeluded mind to be undeluded, know a stuck mind to be stuck and a distracted mind to be distracted, know an expanded mind to be expanded and a narrow mind to be narrow, know a surpassable mind to be surpassable and an unsurpassable mind to be unsurpassable, know a unified mind to be unified and an ununified mind to be ununified, know and a liberated mind to be liberated and an unliberated mind to be unliberated.</p>

<p>If you wish to recall many kinds of past lives, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent. You can recall one life; two, three, four, five lives; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty lives; a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand lives; many eons of moving up in transmigration, many eons of moving down in transmigration, and many eons of moving both up and down in transmigration. You remember you name in a certain place, your clan, appearance, and food, what pleasure and pain you experienced, and how you died. You remember passing away there, and taking rebirth somewhere else. You remember your name there too, your clan, appearance, and food, what pleasure and pain you experienced, and how you died. You remember passing away from there, and taking rebirth here. That is how you recall many kinds of past lives in detail. </p>

<p>If you wish to see the passing on and rebirth of beings with the purified and superhuman divine sense of sight, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent. You can see beings passing on and taking rebirth, having high or low births, in good or bad places, becoming beautiful or ugly. You understand that beings travel on according to their deeds. Those with bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, who criticize the noble ones, have wrong view, and do deeds based on wrong view, get reborn in the lower plane, in a bad destination, a netherworld, or a hell. But those with good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, who do not criticize the noble ones, have right view, and do deeds based on right view, get reborn in a good destination, in a heaven. That is how you see beings passing on and taking rebirth, and understand that they travel on according to their deeds.</p>
<p>If you wish to attain the end the defilements and attain the undefiled liberation of the mind through understanding, then you will be able to do so, to whatever possible extent, realizing it for yourself in this life with special knowledge.”</p>
