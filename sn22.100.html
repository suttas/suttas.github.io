<h1>SN 22.100. The Leash (Second)</h1>
<p>At Savatthi.</p>

<p> “Mendicants, transmigration has no discernible beginning. You will find no start to the transmigration of beings who roam around obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving. Imagine a dog on a leash tied to a strong post or pillar. Whenever he walks, stands, sits, or lies down, he does so right beside that post or pillar. Likewise, unlearned ordinary people perceive form as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’. They perceive feeling, perception, will, and consciousness as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’. Whenever they walk, stand, sit, or lie down, they do so right along those five taken up aspects of existence. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>Mendicants, have you seen the picture called ‘Wandering’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The diversity in that picture called ‘Wandering’ is made by the mind. Yet the mind is even more diverse than that picture. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>I do not know any order of beings so diverse as the animal realm. The diversity in the animal realm is also made by the mind. Yet the mind is even more diverse than that. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>It’s like an artist or a painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board or a wall or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson. When unlearned ordinary people produce a next life, they produce just form, feeling, perception, will, and consciousness.</p>

<p>Mendicants, tell me what you think. Is form permanent or temporary?”</p>

<p>“Temporary, sir.”</p>

<p>“But is what temporary pleasant or painful?”</p>

<p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If it is painful, temporary, and bound to change, is it right to perceive it as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is feeling permanent or temporary?”</p>

<p>“Temporary, sir.”</p>

<p>“But is what temporary pleasant or painful?”</p>

<p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If it is painful, temporary, and bound to change, is it right to perceive it as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is perception permanent or temporary?”</p>

<p>“Temporary, sir.”</p>

<p>“But is what temporary pleasant or painful?”</p>

<p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If it is painful, temporary, and bound to change, is it right to perceive it as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is will permanent or temporary?”</p>

<p>“Temporary, sir.”</p>

<p>“But is what temporary pleasant or painful?”</p>

<p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If it is painful, temporary, and bound to change, is it right to perceive it as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is consciousness permanent or temporary?”</p>

<p>“Temporary, sir.”</p>

<p>“But is what temporary pleasant or painful?”</p>

<p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

<p>“If it is painful, temporary, and bound to change, is it right to perceive it as, ‘it’s me, it’s mine, it’s my self’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Therefore, mendicants, whatever kinds of form there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; to do with the inside or outside world; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime—by correctly understanding them as they really are, you should see them all as, ‘it’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s no self of mine’.</p>

<p>Whatever kinds of feeling there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; to do with the inside or outside world; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime—by correctly understanding them as they really are, you should see them all as, ‘it’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s no self of mine’.</p>

<p>Whatever kinds of perception there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; to do with the inside or outside world; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime—by correctly understanding them as they really are, you should see them all as, ‘it’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s no self of mine’.</p>

<p>Whatever kinds of will there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; to do with the inside or outside world; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime—by correctly understanding them as they really are, you should see them all as, ‘it’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s no self of mine’.</p>

<p>Whatever kinds of consciousness there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; to do with the inside or outside world; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime—by correctly understanding them as they really are, you should see them all as, ‘it’s not me, it’s not mine, it’s no self of mine’.</p>

<p>Mendicants, as a learned noble disciple, when you see this, you get disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, will, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, you lose desire. By losing desire the mind gets liberated. When it is liberated, you will know it. You will understand that the holy life is finished, that the work is done, that rebirth has ended, so there won't be another life.”</p>
