<h1>Iti 44. Two Kinds of Extinguishment</h1>
<p>I heard that this was said by the Buddha, said by the enlightened one:</p>

<p>“Mendicants, there are two kinds of extinguishment. What two? The kind of extinguishment which leaves a remnant and the kind of extinguishment which leaves no remnant.</p>

<p>And what is the kind of extinguishment which leaves a remnant? Then you are enlightened. You have no more defilements, are finished, did the work, dropped the burden, reached the goal. You fully removed what chained you to existence and are fully liberated through wisdom. But through your remaining five senses you still experience agreeable and disagreeable things, feeling pleasure and pain. The ending of desire, anger, and delusion: that is what is called the kind of extinguishment which leaves a remnant.</p>

<p>And what is the kind of extinguishment which leaves no remnant? Then you are enlightened. You have no more defilements, are finished, did the work, dropped the burden, reached the goal. You fully removed what chained you to existence and are fully liberated through wisdom. All that is experienced by you in this life, not being enjoyed, will cool off. That is what is called the kind of extinguishment which leaves no remnant.</p>

<p>Those are the two kinds of extinguishment.”</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said, and this is said about it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> “These are  two kinds of extinguishment<br>
made known by the insightful one,<br>
composed, not needing anything.<br>
One kind happens here, while one is alive:<br>
the watering of existence ends,<br>
but it leaves a remnant.<br>
Leaving no remnant, after this life,<br>
is where existence completely ceases.</p>

<p>Those who see with wisdom<br>
the place free from anything created,<br>
whose minds are liberated,<br>
who ended the watering of existence,<br>
having reached the essence of the teaching,<br>
delighting in ending, <br>
they, the composed,<br>
gave up all states of existence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard that this was also said by the Buddha. </p>
