<h1>AN 9.31. Successive Cessation</h1>
<p>“Mendicants, there are nine stages of successive cessation. What nine? When you reached the first jhana, the perception of sensual objects has ceased. When you reached the second jhana, the mind’s moving and holding have ceased. When you reached the third jhana, delight has ceased. When you reached the fourth jhana, the breath has ceased. When you reached the state of boundless space, the perception of form has ceased. When you reached the state of boundless consciousness, the perception that existed in the state of boundless space has ceased. When you reached the state of nothingness, the perception that existed in the state of boundless consciousness has ceased. When you reached the state of barely any perception, the perception that existed in the state of nothingness has ceased. When you reached the cessation of perception and what’s experienced, perception and the experienced have ceased. Those are the nine stages of successive cessation.” </p>
