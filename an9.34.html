<h1>AN 9.34. Extinguishment</h1>
<p>Venerable Sariputta was once staying at the squirrels’ feeding ground in the bamboo grove near Rajagaha. There he addressed the mendicants: “Venerables, extinguishment is pleasant!”</p>

<p> Then Venerable Udayi asked him: “But, Venerable Sariputta, what can be pleasant when nothing is experienced?”</p>

<p> “Then exactly that, Venerable, is pleasant: that nothing is experienced.</p>

<p>There are these objects of the five senses. What five? Sights cognized with the sense of sight, sounds cognized with the sense of hearing, smells cognized with the sense of smell, flavors cognized with the sense of taste, and tangibles cognized with the sense of touch, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and alluring. Those are the objects of the five senses. The pleasure and happiness that come from these objects of the five senses is called sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>When you get fully separated from sensory experiences and separated from unskillful states of mind, you attain the first jhana, where there is delight and bliss caused by the separation, to which the mind moves and holds on. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on sensory experiences, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on sensory experiences, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is one way you can come to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, when the moving and holding subside, you attain the second jhana, where the mind is confident within and at one, not moving or holding on, so there is just delight and bliss caused by the unification. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the movement, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the movement, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, when the delight fades away too, you attain the third jhana, where even-minded, alert, and aware, you yourself experience just bliss, which the noble ones describe as blissful abiding, even-minded and alert. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on delight, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on delight, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, when the bliss is abandoned, you attain the fourth jhana—the purification of alertness and even-mindedness—where, since pain was abandoned, and earlier happiness and unhappiness ended too, there is just a neutral sensation. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the bliss with even-mindedness, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the bliss with even-mindedness, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, after the complete transcendence of perceptions of form, after the disappearance of impinging perceptions, by not focusing on diversified perceptions but on boundless space, you attain state of boundless space. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on form, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on form, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, after the complete transcendence of state of boundless space, focusing on boundless consciousness, you attain state of boundless consciousness. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of boundless space, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of boundless space, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, after the complete transcendence of state of boundless consciousness, focusing on there being nothing, you attain state of nothingness. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of boundless consciousness, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of boundless consciousness, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, after the complete transcendence of state of nothingness, you attain state of barely any perception. If, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of nothingness, that will be an affliction to you. Just like pain that might come up is mere affliction to one who feels at ease, if, while meditating like that, you begin to perceive or focus back on the state of nothingness, that will be an affliction to you. And the Buddha said that whatever is an affliction is suffering. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.</p>

<p>Further, after the complete transcendence of state of barely any perception, you attain the cessation of perception and what’s experienced. And after you see things by understanding them, your defilements totally end. So that is another way you can get to understand that extinguishment is pleasant.”</p>
